# Clothing Store Competitor Footfall Analysis using Multi-Agents  
**AI pipeline analyzing competitor store traffic trends using LLM + search orchestration**

---

## **Overview**  
This project leverages **LangGraph** (a graph-based LLM orchestration framework) to analyze competitor clothing store footfall patterns and peak hours. It integrates **web search, scraping, and LLM summarization** to deliver real-time competitor insights for retail strategy and staffing decisions.

---

## **Problem**
- Retailers lack **real-time competitor footfall data**, relying on outdated surveys and manual observation.  
- This results in **inefficient decision-making** around promotions and staffing due to limited competitive intelligence.

---

## **Solution**
Built a **LangGraph-powered AI pipeline** that:  
- Scrapes **publicly available data** (e.g., local search, reviews, social media activity).  
- Uses **LLMs for summarization and trend analysis**.  
- Outputs **actionable insights** (peak hours, busiest days, competitor trends).  

**Modular graph nodes designed:**  
- **Data Collection Node:** Web search and scraping  
- **Footfall Estimation Node:** Heuristic + semantic signal processing  
- **Trend Summarization Node:** LLM-based insights generation  

---

## **Impact**
- Reduced competitor analysis turnaround time by **40%** compared to manual research.  
- Enabled **near real-time retail insights** for marketing and staffing optimization.  
- Scalable for **multi-location competitive analysis** (future roadmap).
